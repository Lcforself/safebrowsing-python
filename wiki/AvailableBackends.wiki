Here is the list of currently supported database backends:
  * Sqlite
  * Mysql
  * Postgresql
  * Memcached

==How to write a custom backend==

The custom data backend must subclass the `BaseDBObj` from `base.py` and implement the following `x` methods:

  * *get_version*(*badware_type*)
      `badware_type` is either `malware` or `black`

  * *insert_version_row*(*badware_type*, *version_number*)
      `badware_type` is either `malware` or `black`
      `version_number` is a string (eg: 1:-1 or 1:1835)

  * *update_version_row*(*badware_type*, *new_version_number*, *version_number*)
      `badware_type` is either `malware` or `black`
      `version_number` is a string (eg: 1:-1 or 1:1835)
      `new_version_number` is also similar to `version_number`

  * *insert_rows*(*url_hash_dict*)
      `url_hash_dict` is a map with the `url_hash` as the key and the `badware_code` as the value.

  * *delete_rows*(*url_hash_dict*)
      `url_hash_dict` is a map with the `url_hash` as the key and the `badware_code` as the value.

  * *lookup_by_md5*(*md5_hash_list*)
      `md5_hash` is a list of hashes to be matched against the db.
